<h1>Terms of Use for EUDAT B2DROP Service</h1>
<p>By registering as a EUDAT B2DROP service user (hereafter “B2DROP”) you accept the following conditions of use:</p>
<h2>1. B2DROP</h2>
<p>B2DROP is made available to researchers and communities in order to share and store research data. B2DROP should not be used for personal, recreational, political or commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Use of the EUDAT services and resources is at your own risk. There is no guarantee that the B2DROP service and resources will be available at any time or that it will suit any purpose. EUDAT is not liable to any compensation in case of lost data or loss of service.</p>
<p>Logged information, including information provided by you for registration purposes, is used for administrative, operational, accounting, monitoring and security purposes only. This information may be disclosed, via secured mechanisms, only for the same purposes and only as far as necessary to other organizations cooperating with EUDAT. Although efforts are made to maintain confidentiality, no guarantees are given.</p>
<h2>2. Use</h2>
<p>You must not use B2DROP for any unlawful purpose and not attempt to breach, or breach or circumvent any administrative or security controls.</p>
<p>You must respect the legal protection provided by copyright and licensing of software and data as well as intellectual property and confidentiality agreements. Do not store illegal copies of music, films, software or other media on B2DROP.</p>
<p>You must not store or access any potentially unlawful or clearly inappropriate content or data on B2DROP</p>
<p>You are accountable for the resource usage made by your account and you must therefore protect your account by good enough, difficult to guess passwords</p>
<h2>3. Sanctions</h2>
<p>EUDAT is entitled to regulate, suspend or terminate your access to the service.</p>
<p>You are liable for the consequences of violation of any of the conditions of use.</p>
<p>Any violation being identified will be subject to corrective action, including possible termination of access, legal action, and criminal liability.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Terms of Use for EUDAT</h1>
<h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3>1.1. Use of EUDAT resources</h3>
<p>Any user willing to use EUDAT computing resources must have read and approved the current document beforehand. If required, an agreement reflecting specific projects and use conditions will be put in place between EUDAT and the administrative management of the requesting user.</p>
<h3>1.2. Document objectives</h3>
<p>The current document describes the terms of use of EUDAT shared resources. It lays down the rules that essentially pertain to common sense, and whose purpose is to ensure to all users a high level of quality of resource usage, given the constraints set by the EUDAT infrastructure.</p>
<h3>1.3. Definitions</h3>
<h4>1.3.1. Resource description</h4>
<p>The shared resources made available to users for research purposes are software, servers, storage media and network which are part of the EUDAT infrastructure.</p>
<h4>1.3.2. Field of application</h4>
<p>The current document applies to all EUDAT resources as well as services accessible from local servers.</p>
<h2>2. USERS RIGHTS AND DUTIES</h2>
<p>Users must adhere to all general EUDAT policies and procedures described below including, but not limited to, policies on proper use of information resources and computing and networking facilities, legal use of software, and legal use of administrative data.<p></p>
In case of problems, users can request administrators’ assistance to ensure their rights protection.<p></p>
Users should report any information concerning instances in which the EUDAT Terms of use policy has been or is being violated. In general, reports about violations should be directed initially to the administrators where the violation has occurred whereupon it will be passed on to the custodian of the system. If it is not clear where to report the problem, it may be sent to the EUDAT Help Desk which will redirect the incident to the appropriate person(s) for action or will handle it directly.</p>
<h3>2.1. Personal information</h3>
<p>Users must provide relevant personal information: name, address, project, etc.<p></p>They also must notify administrators with any changes to these records.</p>
<h3>2.2. Access conditions</h3>
<p>Each user is granted a userid and an associated password. This information provides an access right, which can potentially be restricted, to EUDAT resources, for a limited period of time. The range of resources which can be accessed by the user can be limited based on the user needs and the constraints imposed by the sharing of EUDAT resources with other users.<p></p>
This access right to EUDAT resources, as well as the means to use it, is personal, non-transferable, and temporary.<p></p>
Each user is accountable for the resource usage made from his account. To fulfill these responsibilities, some precaution measures should be taken, among which:</p>
<ul style="display: block; list-style-type: disc; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1 em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; padding-left: 40px;">
	<li>Choose their passwords wisely and change them periodically; for example, a password convention based on eight characters including two numbers and a special character should be adopted;</li>
	<li>Safeguard their personal information, passwords and authorization codes, and confidential data;</li>
	<li>Take full advantage of file security mechanisms built into the computing systems;</li>
	<li>Follow the security policies and procedures, laws established to control access to and use of data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.3. Confidentiality</h3>
<p>User files are personal, even if they are physically accessible. Consequently, users should:</p>
<ul style="display: block; list-style-type: disc; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1 em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; padding-left: 40px;">
	<li>Respect the privacy of other users; for example, not to intentionally seek information on, obtain copies of, or modify files, tapes, or passwords belonging to other users or EUDAT;</li>
	<li>Not divulge sensitive data to which they have access without explicit authorization to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. USE OF SHARED RESOURCES</h2>
<p>The use of EUDAT resources by a large numbers of users with different needs requires compliance to some rules. Thus, and in addition of the above, users should:</p>
<ul style="display: block; list-style-type: disc; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1 em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; padding-left: 40px;">
	<li>Respect the intended usage of resources; for example, to use only the account name and password, funds, transactions, data, and processes assigned by service providers, unit heads, or project directors for the purposes specified, and not to access or use other account names and passwords, funds, transactions, data, or processes unless explicitly authorized to do so by the appropriate authority;</li>
	<li>Respect the integrity of the computing and networking facilities; for example, not to intentionally develop or use programs, transactions, data, or processes that harass other users or infiltrate the system or damage or alter the software or data components of a system. Alterations to any system or network software or data component are to be made only under specific instructions from authorized academic staff, unit heads, project directors, or management staff;</li>
	<li>Respect the financial structure of the computing and networking facilities; for example, not to intentionally develop or use any unauthorized mechanisms to alter or avoid charges levied by the University for computing, network, and data processing services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. LEGAL RESTRICTIONS</h2>
<p>EUDAT computing resources are made available for research purposes. There can be some usage restrictions based on country/state laws.</p>
<h3>4.1. Use of academic/research resources</h3>
<p>EUDAT resources should not be used for personal business; for example, computing and network facilities may be used neither in connection with compensated outside work nor for the benefit of organizations not related to EUDAT. It is thus inappropriate to use EUDAT resources for:</p>
<ul style="display: block; list-style-type: disc; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1 em; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; padding-left: 40px;">
	<li>Commercial gain or placing a third party in a position of commercial advantage;</li>
	<li>Any non-EUDAT related activity, including non-EUDAT related communications;</li>
	<li>Commercial advertising or sponsorship except where such advertising or sponsorship is clearly related to or supports the EUDAT mission.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.2. Software protection</h3>
<p>Users must respect the legal protection provided by copyright and licensing of programs and data; for example, not to make copies of a licensed computer program to avoid paying additional license fees or to share with other users.</p>
<h2>5. POTENTIAL SANCTIONS</h2>
<p>Any user who abuses the privilege of their access to EUDAT resources in violation of this policy will be subject to corrective action, including possible termination of access, legal action, and criminal liability.</p>
<h3>5.1. Administrative action</h3>
<p>Access will be removed as soon as the user’s position or projects no longer require it. It can also be terminated if the user abuses the rules defined in this policy document; for example, supplying deliberately erroneous information, using another user's account without authorization, copying or distributing copyrighted or licensed software or data will be considered as a policy violation, and as such will be subject to termination of access.</p>
<h3>5.2. Legal action</h3>
<p>EUDAT will potentially take a legal action based on laws in place in the country or state where the violation has been reported, regardless of the administrative actions taken.</p>
